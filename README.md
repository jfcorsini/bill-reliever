# :moneybag: The Bill Reliever

Sharing expenses are never an easy thing when you live in a lot of people and keeping track of that after a while is almost impossible. Considering all those past headaches, I decided to make this project to get things better in the end of the month for my shared house bills. 

<sup>*Pssst.. Hey kid... this it's not only for house bills!*<sup>

**Are you going on a road trip with friends and your car and paying the gas?**

**Splitting costs for that barbecue on the weekend?**

**Sharing a romantic dinner?**
- [x] :couple_with_heart: Yup: Bill Reliever.

**Out of money and need to get rich fast?**
- [ ] :money_with_wings: No Can do. Good luck!
