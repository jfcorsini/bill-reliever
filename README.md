# :moneybag: The Dutch Treater

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Dutch#cite_note-OED-1), a Dutch Treat is a term used to indicate that each person in some event will pay for themselves. And that's where a Dutch Treater is needed!

Sharing expenses are never an easy thing when you live in a lot of people and keeping track of that after a while is almost impossible. Considering all those past headaches, I decided to make this project to get things better in the end of the month for my shared house bills. 

<sup>*Pssst.. Hey kid... this it's not only for house bills!*<sup>

**Are you going on a road trip with friends and your car and paying the gas?**
- [x] :blue_car: The Dutch Treater shall help you with that.

**Splitting costs for that barbecue on the weekend?**
- [x] :meat_on_bone: Dutch Treater.

**Sharing a romantic dinner?**
- [x] :couple_with_heart: Yup: Dutch Treater.

**Out of money and need to get rich fast?**
- [ ] :money_with_wings: No Can do. Good luck!
